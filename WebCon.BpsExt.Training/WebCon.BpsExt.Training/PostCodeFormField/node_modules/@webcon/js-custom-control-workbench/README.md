# Form Field Extension JS Workbench

The **Form Field Extension JS Workbench** is an application that allows you to run and test JavaScript form field extensions created for the Modern Form in the **WEBCON BPS** system.

The Workbench is a node.js app using the Express framework.

## Build And Run

Before building the application its dependencies have to be installed:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, the application needs to be built:

```bash
npm build
```

The application uses a few environment variables:

-   `DEBUG`, which should be set to `workbench:*` to be able to see diagnostic messages from this application,
-   `port`, port number.

Variables can be set by adding a file named `.env` to the root directory (near this README file) and contents like:

```
DEBUG=workbench:*
port=3000
```

The application can be started by running:

```bash
npm start
```

After running the server application will be available under [http://localhost:\<port\>](http://localhost:3000).
